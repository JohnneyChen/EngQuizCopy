# BakeryApp
This was a express app I created with full CRUD functionality for admin users. Additionally, the app has a shopping cart stored on session and stripe integration for purchase of the products.

The app uses both MongoDB and SQL to store varying types of data.

To see the application, please visit https://johnneybakeryapp.herokuapp.com/ (Note, due to my app being deployed on a heroku hobby dyno, it will likely be asleep and will require some waiting before it loads. I thank you for your patience.)
